    summary:
      'Verra has proposed adopting ton-year accounting to credit temporary carbon storage, and NCX has developed a methodology around this option to credit short-term forest harvest delays. Our comments to Verra raise concerns that ton-year accounting is inconsistent with net-zero goals and long-term temperature targets. The proposed changes also raise unique additionality problems that aren’t adequately addressed by NCX.',
