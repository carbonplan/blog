Last week, KlimaDAO published [an analysis](https://www.klimadao.finance/blog/klimadao-analysis-of-the-base-carbon-tonne) of the Base Carbon Tonne (BCT) — a tokenized “pool” of conventional carbon offset credits that [we criticized](https://carbonplan.org/research/toucan-crypto-offsets) earlier this spring. This post responds to KlimaDAO’s analysis, which presented sunny conclusions that KlimaDAO described as “in tension” with CarbonPlan’s findings on credit quality.

Contrary to KlimaDAO’s framing, none of the data they presented speak to our main conclusion: that the credits underlying the BCT carbon pool are very low quality and therefore do not represent robust climate benefits. As we pointed out in our original article, 99.9% of BCT’s tokenized credits are ineligible for the international aviation industry’s CORSIA program and nearly 85% would be ineligible for trading under Article 6 of the United Nations’ Paris Agreement. While we don’t think that CORSIA or Article 6 rules set a sufficiently high bar for quality — and we expect that forthcoming criteria from the IC-VCM [will be even more restrictive](https://icvcm.org/public-consultation/) — the inadequacy of the BCT credit pool in relation to these much-discussed standards is striking.

## Quality isn’t a popularity contest

Instead of addressing our quality concerns directly, KlimaDAO quibbles with what it means for these credits to be “excluded” from key market segments and emphasizes how some corporate buyers have transacted in off-chain credits from the same projects. In essence, KlimaDAO argues that these low-quality credits are popular. That may well be true, but it’s not responsive to the criticism that the credits lack environmental integrity.

KlimaDAO even goes a step further and suggests CarbonPlan erred in comparing BCT credit quality to the CORSIA standards in the first place:

> As the CORSIA requirements are specific to the aviation industry, rather than a general-purpose group of credits for corporate carbon offsets, the comparison does not appear to be sincere.

Not only is that inaccurate, but it’s deeply ironic. As KlimaDAO’s post observes, the largest corporate user of carbon credits from the offset projects represented in the BCT pool — second only to the BCT pool itself — is Delta Airlines. As an airline, Delta is presumably very mindful of CORSIA eligibility criteria and would be well advised not to use BCTs for any future carbon offsetting claims.

## Standards of convenience

KlimaDAO also repeats the usual bromides about quality control practices among the incumbent carbon offset registries, which are supposed to ensure that all carbon credits represent high-quality, additional climate benefits:

> Clearly, Verra-issued carbon credits are not ‘excluded’ from the market as businesses and consumers are free to purchase and retire these credits – and they do. These ICROA-endorsed standards are typically the most transacted, and most trusted, in the market due to the decades of work done by leading organizations like Gold Standard and Verra to establish rigorous methodologies around the issuance of carbon credits.

It’s a nice idea, but even a cursory look shows that real-world market practices fall short of these ideals. Take, for example, the experience with low-quality HFC-23 credits, which [Europe banned](https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news-your-voice/news/commission-adopts-ban-use-industrial-gas-credits-2011-06-08_en) from its compliance market in 2011. Verra ultimately followed suit several years later and [banned the development](https://verra.org/phasing-out-hfc-23-projects/) of new HFC-23 projects in 2014, but stopped short of prohibiting the issuance of new credits from existing projects. Although quality concerns with HFC-23 credits were [extensively documented](https://doi.org/10.3763/cpol.2010.0096) in the academic literature and are well known in the carbon industry, this experience escaped the attention of BCT’s designers. Carbon traders noticed the resulting loophole and quickly arbitraged the market spread. More than 600,000 HFC-23 credits were tokenized before BCT’s designers put HFC-23 credits [on a blocklist](https://docs.toucan.earth/toucan/bridge/carbon-bridge/blocklist) that prevents future tokenization. (KlimaDAO mentioned these credits in passing, without acknowledging how this example undercuts their stated reliance on registry standards.)

In any case, you don’t have to take our word on quality concerns. Here’s the CEO of Verra describing [a controversy over the quality of old renewable energy projects](https://www.energymonitor.ai/policy/carbon-markets/do-renewables-need-carbon-markets), which constitute the dominant majority of the BCT pool:

> “Those projects were developed before we came to the conclusion that they were no longer additional,” says Verra’s CEO David Antonioli, referring to one of the key criteria for carbon market offset projects, that the reductions they yield would not have taken place without the revenue from the carbon credits. “So they were legitimate at the time they submitted their original requests for registration.”

So much for relying on registry standards.

Consistent with [our recent comments](https://files.carbonplan.org/OSTP-Digital-Assets-Comment-Letter-05-09-2022.pdf), we think the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy got this core dynamic right in its [recent report on the climate and energy implications of blockchain technologies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/09-2022-Crypto-Assets-and-Climate-Report.pdf):

> [W]hile blockchain is often promoted as enhancing trust, it is often the integrity of the underlying carbon reduction or removal project that is questioned, not the counterparty’s likelihood of completing the trade. This issue of trust in [voluntary carbon markets] is not the trust issue that blockchain or distributed ledgers solve.

## An unexpected area of agreement

Perhaps the strangest aspect of KlimaDAO’s post is that it purports to represent the conclusions of a report commissioned from [AlliedOffsets](https://alliedoffsets.com/), a well-known data advisory firm. Here’s how KlimaDAO describes the project:

> KlimaDAO has commissioned analysis of Toucan Protocol’s BCT by AlliedOffsets, a data and analytics consultancy active in the [voluntary carbon market]. The BCT pool was designed by Toucan Protocol with input from KlimaDAO and other advisors, to support the launch of KlimaDAO in October 2021. The results of this work are presented in this article.

Our team was unable to find a link to any such report, so we reached out to AlliedOffsets for more information. AlliedOffsets’ Head of Research confirmed that KlimaDAO had commissioned analysis on market price and credit retirement data for offset projects associated with the BCT pool, but that no report or other public documentation was available. Furthermore, the representative confirmed that while AlliedOffsets reviewed a draft post from KlimaDAO to ensure that their data were presented accurately, they “don’t endorse, renounce, or otherwise comment on” KlimaDAO’s findings.

We respect the team at AlliedOffsets and have no reason to question their market price or credit retirement data. But as far as we’re concerned, the KlimaDAO post makes only one salient point: If you’re in the market for low-quality offsets, you can get a good deal on the blockchain.
