summary: We summarize a public letter from 35 organizations across the CDR ecosystem calling for a scientifically-grounded standards body for long-duration CDR that could review and harmonize emerging protocols.

Last November, [Stripe](https://stripe.com/climate), [Lowercarbon Capital](https://lowercarboncapital.com), [Isometric](https://isometric.com), and CarbonPlan organized a convening focused on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV). At the convening, there was broad agreement that more robust structures are needed to ensure high-quality quantification and verification of carbon removal deployments.

In an [open letter](https://files.carbonplan.org/CDR-MRV-Standards-Letter-02-10-2023.pdf) that was collaboratively written by a working group coming out of the November convening, 35 organizations representing carbon removal buyers, suppliers, verifiers, non-profits, and academics call for the creation of an independent standards initiative that would provide a trusted, scientific stamp-of-approval for CDR protocols.

We envision this initiative establishing a transparent and predictable process for consolidating the best available science, reviewing existing and forthcoming protocols, and harmonizing MRV approaches across and within CDR pathways. This process would provide reference points to ensure that claimed permanent removals are consistently and rigorously quantified and are aligned with [relevant system boundaries](https://carbonplan.org/research/cdr-verification). We also suggest that the initiative should be conscientiously set up to avoid conflicts of interest â€” particularly that funding for the standards initiative should not involve issuing or selling carbon credits.

If you are interested in joining the call for high quality CDR standards, you can add your signature to the open letter [here](https://forms.gle/vnCaF8LtdxoQgEUc8). If you have any questions or would like more information about potential next steps, please feel free to reach out to hello@carbonplan.org.
