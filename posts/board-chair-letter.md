We founded CarbonPlan nearly six years ago. While I could spend many thousands of words describing the work we've done and the impact it has had, what I'm most impressed by is the team we've assembled. I've always believed in what cross-disciplinary teams can accomplish, and how they can combine to be so much more than the sum of their parts. So it's been a true joy to watch what a group of climate scientists, policy experts, ecologists, product designers, open source developers, writers, and operations experts can do together. Our entire team has also grown over the years — in their skills and expertise, and in their thought leadership within the fields of carbon removal, carbon offsets, and climate impacts.

Today is another moment of growth for CarbonPlan’s team. After nearly six years, I’m moving on from being CarbonPlan’s Executive Director, but will remain involved as President and Chair of the Board. I’m taking this step because of a unique opportunity to help start something new and timely in a different arena, and I’ll be able to share more about it soon.

Although this change is happening quickly, we’ve been building the foundation for a successful leadership transition for years. Our Deputy Director, Tracy Aquino Anderson, is ready to step up as Interim Executive Director. I’m confident that she, our incredible team, and our Board (including me), will help ensure a smooth transition. The entire team has my full support, and I’ll remain available to them, whether it’s helping fundraise, reading drafts of articles, or fine-tuning the design of our interactive tools.

The board will be leading a process to identify a new long-term Executive Director, and we’ll share an announcement when that search is open. I am excited about CarbonPlan’s future, and am grateful for the chance to continue in my leadership role on the Board. The problems we face remain daunting, but I can’t think of a better team with which to continue tackling them.
