Last year, we released a [tool](https://carbonplan.org/research/compliance-users) that allows you to explore who is using which offsets to meet compliance obligations in the California cap-and-trade program. We've now updated the tool to reflect the [compliance data](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) that was released in December 2022.

With this update, the tool includes all available data about offset use reported for three full compliance periods (2013-2014, 2015-2017, 2018-2020) and the most recent annual compliance period (2021). Note that during an annual compliance period, regulated companies are only obligated to meet 30% of their compliance obligation. The remainder will come due at the end of the full compliance period (2021-2023) and will be reported publicly in 2024. We'll continue updating the tool as additional data becomes available.

You can read more about the tool in our [original blog post](https://carbonplan.org/blog/compliance-users-release) or check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbonplan/compliance-users) for the data processing that underlies the web tool.
