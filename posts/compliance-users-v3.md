In 2021, we released a [tool](https://carbonplan.org/research/compliance-users) that allows you to explore which regulated entities are using which offsets to compensate for their emissions within the California cap-and-trade program. We have now updated the tool to reflect the [compliance data](https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/our-work/programs/cap-and-trade-program/cap-and-trade-program-data) that was released in December 2023.

With this update, the tool includes all available data about offset use reported for three full compliance periods (2013-2014, 2015-2017, 2018-2020) and two annual compliance periods (2021 and 2022). Note that during an annual compliance period, regulated companies are only obligated to meet 30% of their compliance obligation. The remainder will come due at the end of the full compliance period (2021-2023) and will be reported publicly in 2024. In other words, this data currently reflects a partial story about how regulated entities will use offsets to compensate for their 2021 and 2022 emissions. We'll continue updating the tool as additional data becomes available.

For more context on this tool and the data it surfaces, see our [original blog post](https://carbonplan.org/blog/compliance-users-release) or check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/carbonplan/compliance-users).
